            <h3>How to play ?</h3>
            <p>DemocraticChess is a game about compromises and teamwork. It is a simple game of chess, with all normal rules, except that you can play up to 128 players by each team!</p>
            <p>As soon as your team get to move, you have 40 seconds to vote for what you think is to do next. Move a rook, castle your king or rekt that stupid pawn en-passant style, everything is good. When everyone is done voting, or when the clock runs out, the move with the most vote is cast.</p>
            <p>If there's a tie in the votes, the move where the voters have the most point is cast. To win point, you must be in the first ones to cast your vote on a move that gets chosen thereafter.</p>
            <p>If all players from a team quits or do not vote, there is a win by abandon. If a player do not vote three times in a row, he is kicked out of the game.</p>
            <p>After joining the game, you will be automatically added to one team. You will be able to play at their next move.</p>
            <p>If you do not know the rules of chess, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random">fuck off</a></p>
            <p><b>Good luck !</b></p>
